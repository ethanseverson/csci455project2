# Fundraiser Project - User Manual
Project 2 for CSCI 455 NDSU

Uses UDP protocol for communication

## Prerequisites

 - [FundraiserServer.jar](https://github.com/ethanseverson/csci455project1/releases/download/v1.0.1/FundraiserServer.jar)
 - [FundraiserClient.jar](https://github.com/ethanseverson/csci455project1/releases/download/v1.0.1/FundraiserClient.jar)

*Java JDK is required to run Java applications, it is  recommended to use Java JDK 16 or newer.*

**Anytime the program is requesting input from you (the user), you will be hinted with `>>` in the console.**

## Starting the Server

In a terminal environment, run `java -jar FundraiserServer.jar`

You will be prompted to to enter a server port:
```text
Enter the server port:
>>
```
Make sure the port you are using is available and not reserved for another program. For example, enter `6816`, as this is not a common port used by other applications. More information for checking commonly used ports can be found [here](https://www.speedguide.net/ports.php).

If the server shows the following, your server is successfully set up. (Port number will vary)
`The TCP server is on. Listening for connections on port 6816.`

If you are planning to let other computers connect, you may need to configure your firewall settings depending on your configuration.

## Server Log

As the program is being used, you can check the console of which the server is running to see what events have been taking place.  A few example lines are shown below. (Also notice how the threads are reused after a user logs off)
```

```

## Connecting the Client

In a terminal environment, run `java -jar FundraiserClient.jar`

You will be prompted to enter the IP and port number of the remote server. This example below is an example of connecting to localhost (the server running on the same PC as the client)

> Successful Connection

```text
Enter the server IP:
>> 127.0.0.1
Enter the port:
>> 6816
Connecting to server...
Type exit or quit at any time to disconnect.
You are connected to 127.0.0.1:59015. The current time is 02:33:13 PM
```
Successful connections will be greeted with a connected message and the current time.
> Unsuccessful Connection
```text
Enter the server IP:
>> 127.0.0.1
Enter the port:
>> 6900
Failed to connect. Attempt 1 of 4.
Failed to connect. Attempt 2 of 4.
Failed to connect. Attempt 3 of 4.
Failed to connect. Attempt 4 of 4.
Could not connect to the server after 4 attempts. Exiting.
```
If specifying a IP/port that is not listening, the program will attempt 4 times then exit.
>Invalid IP/Port

```text
>> 10.0.0
Invalid IP address. Please enter a valid IPv4 address.
>> 260.0.0.1
Invalid IP address. Please enter a valid IPv4 address.
>>
```
```text
>> 80000
Invalid port number. Please enter a number between 0 and 65535.
>>
```
If the IP entered is not a valid IPv4 address or the port number is not valid, you will be prompted to try again.

## Navigating the menus
Upon connecting to the server, you will see the main menu. The main menu will display the current fundraisers along with some options.

A new instance of the server will start at a fresh state with nothing stored, as shown.
```text
+------------------------------------+
|        Current Fundraisers         |
+------------------------------------+
|  There are no current fundraisers  |
+------------------------------------+
Type "create" to create a new fundraiser.
>>
```
The only option available at this time will be to create a fundraiser. 

If there are already fundraisers, you will be shown a table with the current fundraisers sorted by deadline. This table will show you the index number, used for navigating to that fundraisers donation view, event name, total amount raised, target amount, deadline, and the donation count.
```text
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                        Current Fundraisers                                         |
+-----+----------------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------+-------------+
|  #  |      Event Name      |  Amount Raised  |  Target Amount  |      Deadline       |  Donations  |
+-----+----------------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------+-------------+
|  1  |  Firefighter Dinner  |  $0.00          |  $80.00         |  October 28, 2023   |  0          |
+-----+----------------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------+-------------+
|  2  |  Church              |  $20.00         |  $200.00        |  October 30, 2023   |  1          |
+-----+----------------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------+-------------+
|  3  |  Halloween Candy     |  $0.00          |  $150.00        |  October 31, 2023   |  0          |
+-----+----------------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------+-------------+
|  4  |  Food Shelf          |  $0.00          |  $400.00        |  November 05, 2023  |  0          |
+-----+----------------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------------+-------------+
Type "create" to create a new fundraiser.
Type "past" to view past fundraisers.
Otherwise, type the number corresponding to the fundraiser above to open it.
>>
```
Each fundraiser entry is populated with a number to the left of its name, use that number to navigate to that fundraiser's donation view. For the scenario above, numbers 1-4 are valid inputs, along with the option to view past fundraisers (since past fundraisers exist), and then the option to create a new fundraiser.

## Creating a Fundraiser

From the main menu, type `create`:
```text
...
>> create
Type "cancel" at any time to return back to main menu.
Please enter the name of the fundraiser.
>> Church
Please enter the target amount for the fundraiser. ($)
>> 200
Please enter the deadline for the fundraiser (yyyy-mm-dd).
>> 2023-10-30
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                    Current Fundraisers                                    |
+-----+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+-------------+
|  #  |  Event Name  |  Amount Raised  |  Target Amount  |      Deadline      |  Donations  |
+-----+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+-------------+
|  1  |  Church      |  $0.00          |  $200.00        |  October 30, 2023  |  0          |
+-----+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+--------------------+-------------+
Type "create" to create a new fundraiser.
Otherwise, type the number corresponding to the fundraiser above to open it.
>>
```
As shown above, after requesting to create  a fundraiser, it will ask you for the event name, target amount, and the deadline. Invalid inputs will be caught and the user will be asked to try again.

The fundraiser deadline must be entered in the format of `yyyy-mm-dd`, for example, `2023-01-01` is valid. Invalid examples include `2023-1-1`, `23-1-1`, `01-01-2023`, etc... You must follow the the format provided, including leading 0s.

Deadlines in the past are allowed to be created, but you will receive a warning:
```text
Please enter the deadline for the fundraiser (yyyy-mm-dd).
>> 2023-07-04
Warning: The date you entered is in the past.
```
Fundraisers in the past will not be allowed to receive any donations.

## Fundraiser donation view
From either the current fundraisers or past fundraisers menu, you can type in the number shown in the list to open that fundraiser. For example, if the event "Church" is 2nd in the list, type `2` then press enter to open the fundraiser donation view.
```text
>> 2
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|              Fundraiser: Church, $20.00 raised.               |
+-----+--------+--------------+----------+----------------------+
|  #  |  Name  |  IP Address  |  Amount  |      Date/Time       |
+-----+--------+--------------+----------+----------------------+
|  1  |  Jack  |  127.0.0.1   |  $20.00  |  10/24/2023 4:02 PM  |
+-----+--------+--------------+----------+----------------------+
Type "back" to go back to fundraisers list.
Type "remove" if you want to delete this fundraiser.
Type "donate" to donate to this fundraiser.
>>
```
You will be presented with a table of donations received for that fundraiser. Each donation will show the name of the person who donated, the IP Address they were connected from, the amount, and finally the date/time the donation was received.

If the fundraiser you viewed is past it's deadline, you will not be able to donate to it. To go back to the fundraisers list, type `back`. If you were viewing a past fundraiser, you will be sent back to the past fundraisers menu, or if you were viewing a fundraiser with a future deadline, you will be sent back to the current fundriasers menu.

To remove a donation, type `remove`. You will need to confirm the deletion by typing `confirm`, as shown:
```text
>> remove
Removing a fundraiser is FINAL. Are you sure you want to continue?.
Type "confirm" if you want to delete, any other input will cancel.
>> confirm
Fundraiser removed.
```

## Donating to a fundraiser

While viewing a fundraisers donation view, type `donate` to add a contribution of your own. You will be asked for your name, then the amount you wish to donate. For demonstration purposes of this assignment, the IP address is also logged for display on the table. Below is an example of a user adding a donation to a fundraiser:
```text
...
>> donate
Type "cancel" at any time to return back to fundraiser.
Please enter your name.
>> Jack
Please enter the amount you wish to donate. ($)
>> 20
Thank you for your donation of $20.00!
